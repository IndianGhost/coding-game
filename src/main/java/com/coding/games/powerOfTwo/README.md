# A power of 2 is a number of the form 2^a, where a is an integer.

#### Example:
2^4 = 2*2*2*2 = 16
Therefore 16 is a power of 2

Given a number n you must output -1 if n is not a power of 2, otherwise you must find which power of 2 is n. (Find a where 2^a=n)

Input
Line 1: An integer n representing the number.
Output
Line 1 : "-1" if n is not a power of 2 or a such as 2^a=n.
