# Pool pump

## Description
Each pump is characterized by its flow rate that defines the time needed to fill a pool depending in its volume. Consequently, two different pumps having two flow rate will take two different durations to fill the same swimming pool.

## Example
pump X takes 1 hour to fill a swimming pool.
pump Y takes 2 hours to fill the same pool.

## Problem
If we use pump X and pump Y at the same time together, how much time it takes to fill the pool?
