# Lose weight

## Description
It is recommended to lose 1% of actual weight per week as a maximum rate.
A fast lose weight could cause serious health problems.

Let's code a program that take the initial weight of a person and the targeted weight (ideal weight) and returns the number of week needed to get the job done  
if that person losed 1% of its weight each week.

## Example
As a simple example, let's assume that a person's weight is actually 85Kg and his ideal weight according to his height is 82.5Kg.  
Let's calculate how many week he needs to lose weight with the recommended percentage per week.
- week 1:  
After week 1, he lost 1% of 85kg which is 0.85kg. So, His weight would become 84.15kg
85Kg - 85Kg * 0.01 = 85Kg * (1 - 0.01) = 85Kg * 0.99 = 84.15Kg
- week 2:  
After week 2, he lost 1% of 84.15kg which is 0.8415kg. So, His weight would become 83.3085kg
84.15Kg * 0.99 = 83.3085Kg
- week 3:  
83.3085Kg * 0.99 = 82.47Kg

So, he will need 3 weeks do it. That's what the program must returns in this case!
